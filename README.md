# Boring Math Games

This is a simple site, designed for [boringmathgames.com](https://boringmathgames.com), it is designed to list games, but feel free to use any part of it for your own projects.

## Customization

This is a template, and is designed to be cusomizable, here are some ways you can do that:
1. To add a new game to a section, you can use this template:
  ```html
  <div class="game">
    <span class="gameTitle">Name of the game</span><a class="gameLink" href="https://example.com">example.com</a>
  </div>
  ```
2. To add a new section, you can use this template:
  ```html
  <div class="sectionTitle">Section Title</div>
      <!-- Add games here -->
  </div>
  ```
3. You can change colors and fonts in `styles.css`, the backgound color(`background-color`)and text color(`color`) are usually in their respective sections(header, section, etc...), with `font-size` and `font-family` in the more specific sections(Section Title, game title)
